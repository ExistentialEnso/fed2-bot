# Thorne's Fed2 Bot

Built for the text-based online game [Federation II](https://federation2.com), this is a bot that automates useful tasks for planet owners.

Cross-platform on anything that can run Node.js (including Windows, macOS, and Linux.)

## Features

üçï Ensures your character eats when stamina is low to avoid death by starvation

üìà Able to "walk up" new exchanges, i.e. slowly increasing stockpiles to 20k tons over time

üöÄ Calculates how many cargo bays your ship has (and refuels periodically!)

üß™ Validates configuration and tells you any problems found

üìí Logs useful information automatically

üòç Detailed output (with cute emoji!)

## Setup

If you don't have them already, install Node.js & npm. There are plenty of guides online on how to do this. You will need a terminal open to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded this repository.

Next, install the dependencies with ```npm install``` (or ```yarn install``` if you prefer yarn like me).

Your username and password data is loaded from a file named ```.env``` not present in the repository for security reasons. Either copy or rename ```template.env``` and edit it to contain your login information.

Planet data is defined in ```planets.js``` and steps are defined in ```steps.js```. I've included my personal configuration for the Enso system as an 
example to help understand how these files should be configured.

Now, finally, you can run the bot by typing ```npm start```.

## Notes

* Your character needs to be in the exchange of the first step's planet when beginning the bot
* Steps must have a type, which must be one of: ```MOVE```, ```TRADE```, ```WALK_UP```
* ```MOVE``` and ```TRADE``` steps require the following planet names: to, from
* ```TRADE``` steps are two way: if the ```to``` planet has surpluses that are deficits on the ```from``` planet, they are hauled
* ```TRADE``` steps put you back on the ```from``` planet when they finish
* The last step should ensure you are back on the planet where the first step starts
* All planet data requires the following arrays: ```toExchange```, ```fromExchange```, ```toLink```, ```fromLink```
* If the planet's orbit is the same as the interstellar link, just provide an empty array: ```[]```
* At least one planet must have ```toRestaurant``` and ```fromRestaurant``` defined to replenish stamina

## Logging

The bot automatically generates the following logs found in the ```logs``` folder:

* ```balances.csv``` - At the start of each cycle, this records your bank balance and the sum of your system's balances
* ```output.txt``` - All terminal output is saved here (minus the color/bold effects -- but it keeps the emoji!)
