# Thorne's Fed2 Bot

Built for the MUD [Federation II](https://federation2.com), this is a Node-powered bot that hauls commodities between planets belonging to a planet owner.

This is currently setup to work with my star system and would require minor code changes to work for others needs.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy ```template.env``` and set the account's username and password. Rename the file simply ```.env```

Now you can run the bot by typing:

```bash
npm start
```
