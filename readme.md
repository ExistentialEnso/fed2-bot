# Thorne's Fed2 Bot

Built for the MUD [Federation II](https://federation2.com), this is a bot that hauls commodities between planets belonging to a planet owner. Cross-platform on anything that can run Node.js (including Windows, macOS, and Linux.)

## Features

üçï Ensures your character eats when stamina is low to avoid death by starvation.

üöÄ Calculates how many cargo bays your ship has (and refuels periodically!)

üß™ Validates configuration and outputs any problems found.

üòç Detailed output (with cute emoji!)

## Setup

If you don't have them already, install Node.js & npm. There are plenty of guides online on how to do this.

Next, install the dependencies with ```npm install``` (or ```yarn install``` if you prefer yarn like me).

Your username and password data is loaded from a file named ```.env``` not present in the repository for security reasons. Either copy or rename ```template.env``` and edit it to contain your login information.

Planet data is defined in ```planets.js``` and steps are defined in ```steps.js```. I've included my personal configuration for the Enso system as an 
example to help understand how these files should be configured.

Now, finally, you can run the bot by typing ```npm start```.

## Notes

* Your character **must** be in the exchange of the first step's planet when beginning the bot
* All step data requires the following fields: type, to, from
* Step type must be either "MOVE" or "TRADE"
* Steps with type "TRADE" put you back on the "from" planet at the end, so the next step should have the same "from" value
* The last step should put you back on the planet where you started
* All planet data requires the following fields: toExchange, fromExchange, toLink, fromLink
* If the planet's orbit is the same as the interstellar link, just provide an empty array: ```[]```
* You must define restaurant info for at least one planet to replenish stamina
