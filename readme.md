# Thorne's Fed2 Bot

This is a Node-powered bot that hauls commodities between planets belonging to a planet owner in the MUD [Federation II](https://www.federation2.com).

This is currently setup to work with my star system and would require minor code changes to work for others needs.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy ```template.env``` and set the account's username and password. Rename the file simply ```.env```

Now you can run the bot by typing:

```bash
npm start
```
